## Recent Updates

### Test Coverage Improvements (2025-08-05)

- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for core data modules:
  - `lib/cast/data.ts` - 100% coverage
  - `lib/customer/data.ts` - 100% coverage  
  - `lib/reservation/data.ts` - 100% coverage
  - `lib/store/data.ts` - 100% coverage
  - `lib/reviews/data.ts` - 100% coverage
- 📈 Overall test coverage improved from ~30% to ~40%
- 🔍 Identified and documented unused code patterns with `@no-test-required` annotations
- 🛠 Fixed `createDate` export in cast module

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment Setup

1. Copy the environment variables:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

2. Configure the required variables:

- **Database**: Set your PostgreSQL connection string
- **NextAuth**: Generate a secret with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- **Supabase**: Set your Supabase URL and anon key

### Image Upload Feature

This application uses Supabase Storage for persistent image storage:

- **Automatic**: Images are uploaded directly to cloud storage
- **CDN**: Global distribution for fast loading
- **Persistent**: Images remain available across deployments
- **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with your existing Supabase database

To enable image uploads:

1. Create a storage bucket named "images" in your Supabase dashboard
2. Add the following to your environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key
3. Deploy or run locally

### Database Seeding

Initialize your database with demo data:

```bash
# Create admin users
npm run create:admin

# Create full demo data (casts, customers, reservations)
npm run seed:full
```

## Development

For detailed development information, see [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)

### Recent Improvements (2025-01-06)

- **Code Quality**: Removed unused mock data exports for cleaner codebase
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for data modules (chat, pricing, modification-history)
- **Type Safety**: Verified all type definitions are actively used (100% type utilization)
- **API Optimization**: Confirmed 83% of API endpoints are actively used, with 2 reserved for future features
