# Image Upload - Supabase Storage Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of image upload persistence using Supabase Storage, which has been chosen to integrate seamlessly with the existing Supabase database infrastructure.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Storage Service Architecture

We've implemented a storage abstraction layer to allow for future flexibility:

```typescript
// lib/storage/types.ts
export interface StorageService {
  upload(file: File, options?: UploadOptions): Promise<UploadResult>
  delete(path: string): Promise<DeleteResult>
  getPublicUrl(path: string): string
  exists(path: string): Promise<boolean>
}
```

### 2. Supabase Storage Implementation

The `SupabaseStorageService` class implements the `StorageService` interface:

- **File validation**: Checks file size (max 5MB) and type (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- **Automatic path generation**: Creates unique filenames with timestamps
- **Public URL generation**: Provides CDN-backed URLs for uploaded images
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error messages for common issues

### 3. API Integration

The `/api/upload` endpoint has been refactored to use the storage abstraction:

```typescript
const storage = getStorageService()
const result = await storage.upload(file, { folder: 'uploads' })
```

### 4. Configuration

Required environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key

### 5. Migration Script

The migration script (`scripts/migrate-images-to-blob.ts`) has been updated to:

1. Upload existing images from `/public/uploads` to Supabase Storage
2. Update database references to use the new Supabase URLs
3. Create a backup mapping file for rollback purposes

## Benefits of Supabase Storage

1. **Integrated Solution**: Works seamlessly with existing Supabase database
2. **Cost Effective**: Generous free tier (1GB storage, 2GB bandwidth)
3. **CDN Support**: Automatic global distribution
4. **Simple API**: Easy to use with the Supabase client
5. **Security**: Built-in RLS (Row Level Security) support
6. **Backup**: Automatic backups with database snapshots

## Testing

All existing tests have been updated and are passing:

- Upload API tests verify proper validation and error handling
- Mock storage service allows for isolated testing
- Integration tests ensure end-to-end functionality

## Future Considerations

The storage abstraction layer allows for easy switching between providers if needed:

- AWS S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Cloudflare R2
- Local file system (for development)

Simply implement the `StorageService` interface and update the factory function in `lib/storage/index.ts`.
